CBI Weather App
===============


## Chrome Extension

The Chrome extension is written in JavaScript. It can be loaded in several ways:

### Chrome Web Store (Production)

Install the latest published version by visiting the Chrome Web Store. This app
is only available via this link, and will not appear in search results:

### Load Unpacked Extension (Development)

Visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), click 'Load Unpacked Extension', and select the `./chrome` dir


## OS X App

This app is less sophisticated, since I don't know Swift. It's a work-in-progress while I learn how to write OS X apps.
